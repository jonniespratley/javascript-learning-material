If you want more in-depth information I suggest you read the JavaScript reference. [JavaScript reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference)


## Front End Handbook
I suggest taking a look at [Front End Handbook](https://www.frontendhandbook.com/) as it has alot
of resources for you to read about that will help you with this material.


## JavaScript Console
The following is a code console that you can modify code and run the example.

<!-- js-console -->
```js
var a = 1 + 2;
console.log(a);
```
