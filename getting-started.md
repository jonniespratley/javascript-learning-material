#### What is Node.js & NPM
Node.js is a platform that is built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime engine. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.

NPM is the official package manager for Node.js, and is bundled and installed automatically with the environment. NPM runs through the command line and manages the dependencies for an application that are available on the npm registry.

> Node.js version used in this is v7.1.1
