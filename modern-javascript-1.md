## Functions as Callbacks
At the heart of just about every JavaScript program are events. When you write a web application, you use JavaScript to add interactivity to your page, which means your program needs to respond to events generated by the browser, and events generated by the user.

In JavaScript, we use functions to handle events. We often refer to event handlers as callbacks because when an event happens, we "call back" to a function to handle that event. Callbacks aren't always about browser and user events, but often they are.

You've probably used functions to handle events like the page load and button click events. If you've used Ajax (also known as XHR) or Geolocation in your JavaScript programs, you're probably familiar with functions used as callbacks. For instance, with Ajax, you provide a function to "call back" when XMLHttpRequest has loaded data from a file. With Geolocation, you provide a function to "call back" when the browser has located your position. Let's take a quick look at a basic Geolocation example so you can see how we use a function as a callback:
